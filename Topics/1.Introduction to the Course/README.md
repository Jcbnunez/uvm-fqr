# Evolutionary Theory...
... that living things are systems that change over space and time.

## These changes are driven by processes that can be measured and predicted (to some degree)
1.Some processes are deterministic: Have predictable outcomes that are repeatable and devoid of randomness
*Useful sometimes to think of point estimates as predictive outcomes
2.Some processes are stochastic: Have outcomes, that can be described, yet they governed by randomness
*Useful to think of distributions as “predictive” outcomes 

## Example of deterministic processes

*Always “down”
*Always “9.8 m/s2” (+/- other factors)
*Yes, the system has noise (i.e., air drag) … But that is not the point
