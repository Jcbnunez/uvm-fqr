# Lesson 1: Intro to the VACC
Program in Biological Data Science and QuEST

## Understanding the VACC
An overly simplistic, yet intuitive introduction to our supercomputer.

1. Supercomputers do not exist in the cloud. They are physical things. We can interact with them via the internet (the cloiud?)
2. Supercompiters such as the VACC have equipmemnt that is devoted to various purposes. 
2.1. The analyses clusters
	* **Bluemoon**: A 161 node, 8392 core, high-performance computing cluster, modeled after national supercomputing centers, supporting large-scale computation, low-latency networking for MPI workloads, large memory systems, and high-performance parallel ﬁlesystems.
	* **DeepGreen**: DeepGreen is a new massively parallel cluster deployed in Summer 2019 with 80 GPUs capable of over 8 petaﬂops of mixed-precision calculations based on the NVIDIA Tesla V100 architecture.
	* **BlackDiamond**: This cluster is built using AMD’s 2nd Gen AMD EPYC processor, which pushes the boundaries for x86 performance, efficiency, security features, and overall system throughput.

	2.2. Storage 
	* **Netfiles:** P.I.s usually pay a fee to maintain long term storage. Soem storage is included in the faculty package. Trainees and staff are dependent on the PI. Ususally many people can access these files.

	2.3. File systems
	
	* **GPFS 1**: Your home directory. Only you can access this.  
	* **GPFS 2**: Your scratch directiry. Only you can access this.  

## What can we do in, and how we can access into, the VACC
