# Creating functions to simulate selection

The goal of this practicum are:
* To create a function that can simulate determistic patterns of selection 
* To generare a script with said function that can take user inputs
* To deploy the script using arrays to simulate various scenarious
* To analyze the outputs

## Part 1: creating a fucntion for natural selection

The first challenge is to assess what are the variables that we may request from the user in order to generate a final product. This is an important consderation for us as "coders" that we must think about before jumping to coding. -- _Coding begins at the white board._

### What variables may we want to consider?

* allele frequencies?
* fitnesses? 
* Dominance coefficients?
* Population sizes?
* etc... etc..
